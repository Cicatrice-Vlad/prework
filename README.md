## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- For research and learning from scratch the beautiful side of Front end Web Dev, I have created this website as a guidance in my future projects.
- This project has the sole purpose to keep the information that I gather as I go along the way to learn Front End Web Development procedures, features, languages, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and other personal and professional purposes.
- This project is helping in finding the solutions for all the known or unknown problems/issues that a Front End Web Developer such as myself might find throughout the path of learning and developing.
- In this project I found out that the HTML, CSS and JavaScript are very useful and work togheter in forming a real Webpage or Webpages also known as a Website. Or at least it is a starting point that can lead to many more other creations like apps, pop-ups, ad-ons and so on. It will be an incredible journey to constant develop as well as self-develop myself while contributing to the IT society throughout the process for as much as possible and one can do.
